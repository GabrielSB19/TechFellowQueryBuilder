## Data Analysis

Firstly, it is essential to analyze the data to comprehend its structure and pattern. This process will yield the most common use cases and those that add value for the user.

The dataset used for this project is sourced from The World Bankâ€™s Education Dataset. This dataset encompasses various indicators across different themes, with each indicator associated with a country worldwide. The application selectively considers indicators based on the global population to achieve a more refined data structure.
